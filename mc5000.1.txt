NAME
     mc5000 - assembler and programmer for rickp's MC5000 Dev Kit

SYNOPSIS
     mc5000 [-v] [-u n] [-l dev | -o outfile] [infile]

DESCRIPTION
     The MC5000 is a real-world instantiation of the fictional family of
     microcontrollers at the center of Zachtronics' programming puzzle game
     "Shenzhen I/O".  The MC5000 Dev Kit employs two low-cost Padauk PFS173
     chips to interpret MCxxxx code.

     The mc5000 utility reads MCxxxx assembly from infile or standard input
     and translates it to MC5000 byte code.  The result can be sent to a
     target chip via the board's serial port or written to outfile.

     The options are as follows:

     -l dev  Program the target chip via the given serial port device.	This
	     option is mutually exclusive with -o.

     -o outfile
	     Write the assembled program byte code to outfile.	This option is
	     mutually exclusive with -l.

     -u n    Select MCU #n as the target chip.	The default is MCU #1.

     -v	     Print extra informational messages during programming.  If given
	     two times, all serial communication is logged to the standard
	     output.

EXIT STATUS
     The mc5000 utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

AUTHORS
     The MC5000 Dev Kit was created by GitHub user rickp.  The mc5000 utility
     was written by Sven M. Hallberg <pesco@khjk.org> as an alternative to the
     original programming software.
