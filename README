DESCRIPTION
     An assembler and programmer for rickp's MC5000 dev kit.

     The MC5000 is a physical realization of the fictional microcontroller
     family from the game Shenzhen I/O by Zachtronics. It uses the low-cost
     Padauk PFS173 microcontroller.

     This program translates MCxxxx assembly to byte code and writes it to
     any of the MC5000 chips via the board's USB serial port.

USAGE
     Run 'mc5000 -h' for quick help.

     Refer to the supplied manpage mc5000.1 for details.

BUILDING
     Run make.

     The program is designed for a Unix environment, specifically OpenBSD.
     It has also been tested on Debian GNU/Linux.
